/**
 * `$Diagnoses` and `$Problems` — the outcome collections.
 *
 * A script can ask about the outcomes the clinician just confirmed:
 *
 *   ($DangerSigns = 'Grun' or $Diagnoses = 'RDN') and $NobCPAP = false
 *
 * These are the only two keys whose value is produced by a screen rather than
 * typed into one. The web editor already models them: `Diagnoses` comes from a
 * screen of type `diagnosis`, `Problems` from type `problems`, and a condition
 * may only use them at a position after that screen
 * (lib/conditional-expression/script-outcomes.ts).
 *
 * They resolve to the CONFIRMED outcomes, read from the entry that screen
 * already committed — never recomputed. That matters for two reasons:
 *
 *  - Suggested diagnoses are derived by evaluating diagnosis expressions, which
 *    themselves go through parseCondition. Resolving `$Diagnoses` by computing
 *    them would let a diagnosis expression that references `$Problems` recurse
 *    into the evaluator that is already running. Reading committed entries
 *    cannot recurse.
 *  - The clinician can reject a suggestion. A rejected outcome stays in the
 *    entry with `how_agree === 'No'`, and must not count as present.
 *
 * Outcomes are emitted as a `multi_select`-shaped entry so the existing
 * chunking in parseCondition makes `$Diagnoses = 'RDN'` true when ANY confirmed
 * outcome is RDN — the same way a multi-select answer already behaves.
