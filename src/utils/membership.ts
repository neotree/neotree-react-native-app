/**
 * Membership operators (`includes` / `excludes`) for conditional expressions.
 *
 * These are resolved to a literal `true`/`false` before the surrounding
 * expression goes through key substitution and eval, so a membership can sit
 * alongside any other term on the same line.
 *
 * Semantics, matching the web editor's grammar:
 *
 *   $Key includes ('a','b')     the answer contains ANY of a or b
 *   $Key excludes ('a','b')     the answer contains NONE of a or b
 *
 * The two are exact inverses, which the editor relies on: its legacy-negation
 * rewrite turns `!($K includes (...))` straight into `$K excludes (...)`
 * (lib/conditional-expression/legacy.ts). Reading `includes` as "all of" would
 * break that identity, and would also make `excludes` over several values
 * useless — "not all of" is true for almost any single-valued key.
 *
 * `or_includes` / `or_excludes` are legacy and unknown to the editor grammar
 * (lib/conditional-expression/parser.ts). `or_includes` is now identical to
 * `includes`; `or_excludes` keeps its old "at least one is absent" meaning.
 * Both are accepted only for backwards compatibility and should be migrated.
 *
 * An unanswered key has an empty answer set. That makes `excludes` true and
 * `includes` false, which lines up with how an unsubstituted `$Key` behaves
 * under `=` / `!=` elsewhere in the runtime.
 *
 * This module is deliberately dependency-free so it can be unit tested without
 * standing up the script context.
